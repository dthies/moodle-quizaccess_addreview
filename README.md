# Add review attempt #

Allows students that missed a quiz to review the feedback anyway

This plugin changes the behaviour of the quiz after it is closed. Students
that have not attempted the quiz at all will be able to attempt it once
however the attempt will end immediately before they have a chance to
answer. The attempt will appear for review according to the conditions
set for normal attempts.

Note, this plugin requires Moodle 2018051700.

The plugin is installed under `mod/quiz/accessrule/addreview`.  For example

    git clone https://github.com/dthies/moodle-quizaccess_addreview.git mod/quiz/accessrule/addreview

To enable it for a particular quiz, the box for the rule under 'Additional
restrictions' should be check.  That is to say navigate to

    Edit settings -> Extra restrictions on attempts -> Allow review attempt
