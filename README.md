# Add review attempt #

Allows students that missed a quiz to review the feedback anyway

This plugin changes the behaviour of the quiz after it is closed. Students
that have not attempted the quiz at all will be able to attempt it once
however the attempt will be submitted immediately before they have a
chance to answer.
